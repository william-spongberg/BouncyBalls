# Bouncy Balls

Bouncy Balls is a simple game inspired by the many viral short videos online of balls bouncing around the screen, and the interesting sounds and visual forms they take. The game was created using the Unity2D game engine in a day as a fun little project to play around with the newest version of Unity (version 6). The game is available to play online at itch.io [here](https://wspongberg.itch.io/bouncy-balls).
